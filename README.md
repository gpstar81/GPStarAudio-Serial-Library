GPStar Audio and GPStar Audio XL are polyphonic audio players capable of playing up to 14 stereo WAV files at the same time, layering them, mixing and crossfading with independent track control of volume, pause, resume.

It has a 3.5mm stereo auxilliary jack, and its onboard stereo amplifier is capable of driving 2 speakers (2.5W @ 4Ω or 1.25W @ 8Ω per channel) from the onboard amplifier. Powered with 5V to the 5V and GND pins it can be controlled over a serial interface with an Arduino or any other microcontroller. It can be used for a variety of projects such as toys, musical instruments, props or any other embedded projects.

Example code to demonstrate some of the GPStar Audio's features can be found in the examples folder.

## Serial commands ##

**GPStarAudio.start(SerialObject)** - This must be called first to setup the serial communications. You must initalise the serial object and pass it to the function. Example: `Serial.begin(57600);` `GPStarAudio.start(Serial);`

**GPStarAudio.flush()** - Flushes all data from the GPStarAudio instance. Note this is called automatically in `start()` and so should not be necessary after initialisation.

**GPStarAudio.serialFlush()** - Flushes the serial buffer of whichever serial UART is associated with this GPStarAudio instance.

**GPStarAudio.hello()** - Call this to have the GPStar Audio respond with a hello request. See next method to check for the return value.

**GPStarAudio.gpstarAudioHello()** - Returns a `bool` for whether the `hello()` command was accepted by the GPStar Audio and if `true` populates the variable for the total number of tracks on the micro SD card (see `GPStarAudio.getNumTracks()` below).

**GPStarAudio.requestSystemInfo()** - Call this to have the GPStar Audio respond with an `RSP_SYSTEM_INFO` packet. This function is provided for backwards compatibility with other polyphonic audio boards.

**GPStarAudio.wasSysInfoRcvd()** - Returns a `bool` for whether the `requestSystemInfo()` command was accepted by the GPStar Audio and if `true` populates the variable for the total number of tracks on the micro SD card (see `GPStarAudio.getNumTracks()` below). This function is provided for backwards compatibility with other polyphonic audio boards.

**GPStarAudio.requestVersionString()** - Call this to have the GPStar Audio respond with an `RSP_VERSION_STRING` packet containing the current software version number. See next method to check for the return value.

**GPStarAudio.getVersion(char\* version)** - Returns a `bool` for whether the `RSP_VERSION_STRING` packet was received. Pass a `char` array of size `VERSION_STRING_LEN` as the parameter to store the version string value.

**GPStarAudio.update()** - Calling this will process any incoming serial data from GPStar Audio. If you are using `currentTrackStatus()` calls, then you will want to call this often.

**GPStarAudio.getNumTracks()** - This returns a `uint16_t` of the number of tracks on the micro SD card. Note that you must have called `hello()` followed by `gpstarAudioHello()` first for this to return a valid value.

**GPStarAudio.masterGain(int16_t gain)** - This sets the master gain (in dB) of the audio output amplifier. The range is `-59` (quietest) to `24` (loudest). Note that `24` is only achievable using the speaker amplifier. If using the headphone jack, the output amplifier gain has a maximum of `18`.

**GPStarAudio.trackPlaySingle(uint16_t trk)** - This will stop any tracks that are currently playing and play the selected track number provided.

**GPStarAudio.trackPlaySingle(uint16_t trk, bool lock)** - This will stop any tracks that are currently playing and play the selected track number provided. If `lock` is set to `true`, the track will not not ever be unloaded or stopped from the channel it has acquired if the maximum number of channels are in use unless you manually tell the track to stop.

**GPStarAudio.trackPlay(uint16_t trk)** - This will play the provided track number, mixing and overlaying it with any other tracks that are currently playing.

**GPStarAudio.trackPlay(uint16_t trk, bool lock)** - This will play the provided track number, mixing and overlaying it with any other tracks that are currently playing. If `lock` is set to `true`, the track will not not ever be unloaded or stopped from the channel it has acquired if the maximum number of channels are in use unless you manually tell the track to stop.

**GPStarAudio.trackStop(uint16_t trk)** - This stops the provided track number if it is currently playing and frees the channel it was using.

**GPStarAudio.trackPause(uint16_t trk)** - This will pause the provided track number if it is currently playing. The track will still stay loaded and hold the current channel it is allocated.

**GPStarAudio.trackResume(uint16_t trk)** - This will resume the provided track if it is currently paused.

**GPStarAudio.trackLoop(uint16_t trk, bool enable)** - This will set a track to loop or not loop. When set to loop, the track will automatically replay itself until you call `GPStarAudio.trackStop(int t)` or set the the track looping off. Set to true to enable looping or false to disable looping.

**GPStarAudio.trackGain(uint16_t trk, int16_t gain)** - This will set the volume of the provided track number. The volume range is `-59` (quietest) to `0` (loudest). This only affects the volume of this track within the mix, not the gain of the output amplifier.

**GPStarAudio.trackFade(uint16_t trk, int16_t gain, uint16_t time, bool stopFlag)** - This will fade the currently playing provided track number. The track volume will logarithmically fade to the target gain you provide from whatever volume the track is already playing at. The `stopFlag` by default is `false` which will keep the track playing after the fade. Setting the `stopFlag` to `true` will make the track stop playing and free its channel after the fade has finished.

**GPStarAudio.trackLoad(uint16_t trk)** - This will assign the provided track number to a channel paused. This can be useful when combined with the `resumeAllInSync()` method listed below.

**GPStarAudio.trackLoad(uint16_t trk, bool lock)** - This will assign the provided track number to a channel paused. If `lock` is set to `true`, the track will not not ever be unloaded from the channel it has acquired if the maximum number of channels are in use unless you manually tell the track to stop. This can be useful when combined with the `resumeAllInSync()` method listed below.

**GPStarAudio.stopAllTracks()** - This will stop all tracks that are currently playing and free all channels.

**GPStarAudio.resumeAllInSync()** - This will resume all tracks which are currently paused at the exact same time.

**GPStarAudio.samplerateOffset(uint16_t offset)** - This sets the sample-rate offset of the main output mix. The range for the offset is `-32767` to `32676`, giving a speed range of 1/2x to 2x or a pitch range of down one octave to up one octave. If audio is playing you will hear the result immediately. If audio is not playing, the new sample-rate offset will be used the next time a track is started.

**GPStarAudio.setLED(bool status)** - You can turn off the LED status indicator by setting `status` to `false`. Passing `true` enables the LED again. By default the LED on GPStar Audio flashes and blinks to provide various status updates.

**GPStarAudio.gpstarShortTrackOverload(bool status)** - Enabled by default. GPStar Audio will detect mulitple versions of the same sound playing in succession and prevent it from overloading and taking too many audio channels, instead replaying the file to save system resources.

**GPStarAudio.gpstarTrackForce(bool status)** - Disabled by default. When enabled, GPStar Audio will forcibly take a audio channel when requested to play a new track even if all channels in use and locked.

**GPStarAudio.trackPlayingStatus(uint16_t trk)** - This will ask GPStar Audio if the provided track number is playing. After calling this method, call the `GPStarAudio.currentTrackStatus(uint16_t trk)` method to find out if the track is playing or not.

**GPStarAudio.currentTrackStatus(uint16_t trk)** - This will retrieve the status of a the provided track number if it is playing. You will want to use the `GPStarAudio.trackPlayingStatus(uint16_t trk)` method first to ask if the provided track is playing, then call this method soon after to retrieve the response.

**GPStarAudio.setReporting(bool enable)** - Provided for backwards compatibility with existing polyphonic audio boards, but has no effect on GPStar Audio (which always has track reporting enabled).

**GPStarAudio.setAmpPwr(bool enable)** - Provided for backwards compatibility with existing polyphonic audio boards, but has no effect on GPStar Audio (which uses a headphone sense circuit to dynamically switch between the headphone and speaker amplifiers).

**GPStarAudio.setTriggerBank(uint8_t bank)** - Provided for backwards compatibility with existing polyphonic audio boards, but has no effect on GPStar Audio (which does not support creation of audio banks).

## Configuration file and syntax usage
A configuration file is not required. However you can configure many settings by placing a GPStarAudio.ini configuration file into the root of the Micro SD Card. Many options can be set, such as the default volume, serial communication baud rate, LED settings and to how customising the GP action pins for how they handle playback.

A example file can be found in this repository. When no configuration file is present on the Micro SD Card, then GPStar Audio XL will revert to all the standard default settings.

The syntax of the file is very simple which use enclosed square brackets to setup configuration areas. 
Example syntax is as follows:

**[gpstarconfig]:** This area can set the general settings of the board. If none of these settings exist in the ini file, then the system will default to the default settings for each option.

**volume&#95;amplifier:** This sets the master gain (in dB) of the stereo speaker amplifier. The range is `-53` (quietest) to `24` (loudest). The default is `0`.

**volume&#95;aux:** This sets the master gain (in dB) of the stereo headphone amplifier. The range is `-59` (quietest) to `18` (loudest).  The default is `0`.

**serial&#95;baud&#95;rate:** You can configure the speed of the serial communication used for controlling the GPStar Audio. The default is `57600`.

**led&#95;off:** Control whether the onboard status LED flashes or not during playback or non playback. Valid values are 0 for allowing the LED to function or `1` for disabling the LED. The default is `0`.

## GP pin configuration and usage
Unique to GPStar Audio XL are the GP pins. These can be setup so you can play sounds without any coding. This area contains playback setup and configuration of the 20 GP pins. The pins are identified by gp1_ prefix in the ini file. The range is from gp1_ up to gp20_. Please refer to the example configuration file located in this repository for usage.

Note that these do not need to be configured for the GP pins to operate and if `GPStarAudio.ini` is not on the micro SD card the default settings are loaded for the GP pins.

**[gpstarmode]** Valid settings for this is `normal`, or `repeat`. Normal plays the track and it stops when it finishes. Repeat will make the track loop forever unless re activated again to do something else.

**[gpstartrigger]** Control how the playback is assigned to this GP pin. Valid settings are `press` or `hold`. Pressing will activate the GP pin and play the track. Hold will also activate any setting assigned to the GP pin for the track, however releasing will make it perform an associated action setup with **[gpstarplayback]**. Default is `normal`.

**[gpstarplayback]** This sets what the GP pin action will do if it is already playing a track associated with it. Valid settings are `stop`, `pause`, `restart`. When pause is used, activating the GP pin again will resume the playback of the track where it left off.

**[gpstartracks]** The track number on the MicroSD Card. The default is the pin number of this GP pin. For example, set this to 100 to play the wav file with the 100_ prefix.

**[gpstartrackvolume]** The default volume for the individual track playback. Valid ranges are 0 to -59, with 0 being the loudest and -59 being the most quiet. The default is 0.

**[gpstarfade]** Control if a track does any fading. Valid settings are `nofade`, `fadeout`.

**[gpstarfadeduration]** Set the duration in seconds of the track fade if enabled. The default is 0.

## Preparing your audio files
GPStar Audio plays audio from uncompressed WAV files from a MicroSD Card of any size formatted as FAT32. 
Please note that MicroSD cards larger than 32GB often come formatted in exFAT. Please reformat these cards as FAT32 using 32KB block size. Mac and Linux users can format normally with their standard disk utility software. Windows users will need to use the FAT32 Format utility found on the gpstartechnologies.com support and downloads page to format cards with capacities larger than 32GB. 

The currently supported WAV file format is 16 bit at 44.1kHz stereo. Other audio formats can be easily converted with any audio editor or free ones. All WAV files must be loaded onto the root of the MicroSD card and named appropriately with a prefixed number sequence of `###_filename.wav`. For example, `001_sound1.wav, 002_sound2.wav, 4000_sound3.wav`. The most and only important thing to remember in the naming is the `###_` prefix for all tracks. 

You must also **remove** any metadata that may be present in the WAV files. This can be done in many free audio editors such as Audacity.

**It is highly recommended to use high quality and fast MicroSD cards, otherwise audio playback can be slow or delayed. We recommend cards as fast or faster than Sandisk Extreme A1/A2 U3 V30.**
